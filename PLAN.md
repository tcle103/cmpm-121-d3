# D3: World of Bits

## Game Design Vision

Location-based game (like Pokemon Go) where players can navigate the real world to pick up and deposit tokens to craft a specific high-valued token through combining lower-value ones (like 4096 and Threes).

## Technologies

- TypeScript for most game code, little to no explicit HTML, and all CSS collected in common `style.css` file
- Deno and Vite for building
- GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages for deployment automation

## Assignments

### D3.a: Core mechanics (token collection and crafting)

- [ ] copy main.ts to reference.ts for future reference
- [ ] delete everything in main.ts
- [ ] put a basic leaflet map on the screen
- [ ] draw the player's location on the map
